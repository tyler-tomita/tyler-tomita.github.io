title: "The Similarity Structure of Real-World Memories"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/memory-similarity
excerpt: 'How do we mentally organize our memories of life events? Two episodes may be connected because they share a similar location, time period, activity, spatial environment, or social and emotional content. However, we lack an understanding of how each of these dimensions contributes to the perceived similarity of two life memories. We addressed this question with a data-driven approach, eliciting pairs of real-life memories from participants. Participants annotated the social, purposive, spatial, temporal, and emotional characteristics of their memories. We found that the overall similarity of memories was influenced by all of these factors, but to very different extents. Emotional features were the most consistent single predictor of overall memory similarity. Memories with different emotional tone were reliably perceived to be dissimilar, even when they occurred at similar times and places and involved similar people; conversely, memories with a shared emotional tone were perceived as similar even when they occurred at different times and places, and involved different people. A predictive model explained over half of the variance in memory similarity, using only information about (i) the emotional properties of events and (ii) the primary action or purpose of events. Emotional features may make an outsized contribution to event similarity because they provide compact summaries of an event’s goals and self-related outcomes, which are critical information for future planning and decision making. Thus, in order to understand and improve real-world memory function, we must account for the strong influence of emotional and purposive information on memory organization and memory search.'
