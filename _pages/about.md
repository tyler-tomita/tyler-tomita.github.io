I have a passion for artificial intelligence (AI) and firmly believe in its potential to better the world we live in. My experience as a PhD student in the Biomedical Engineering program at Johns Hopkins under the mentorship of Dr. Joshua Vogelstein afforded me the opportunity to develop machine learning methods and apply them to problems in biomedical science and healthcare. Thus, I collaborated with biomedical scientists and medical doctors, witnessing firsthand how AI can improve the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of disease.

My desire to learn and push the boundaries of AI led me to accept a postdoc position in the Psychological and Brain Sciences Department at Johns Hopkins under the mentorship of Dr. Christopher Honey. The unique types of data and problems faced by psychologists, cognitive scientists, and neuroscientists inspired me to develop and apply novel machine learning approaches. Furthermore, it inspired me to use what is known about human cognition to achieve more human-like neural network machine learning algorithms, particularly in the context of transfer learning, continual learning, and representation learning. I have come to believe that a critical step in advancing AI is to understand and apply principles of natural intelligences.
