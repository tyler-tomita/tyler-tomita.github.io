I have a passion for AI and firmly believe in its capacity to improve the quality of life for the greatest number of people. My experience as a PhD student in the Biomedical Engineering program at Johns Hopkins afforded me the opportunity to develop machine learning methods and apply them to problems in biomedical science and healthcare. Thus, I collaborated with biomedical scientists and medical doctors, witnessing firsthand how AI can improve the diagnoses, treatments, and prognoses of diseases.

My passion to learn and push the boundaries of AI led me to accept a postdoc position in the Psychological and Brain Sciences Department at Johns Hopkins. The unique types of data and problems faced by psychologists, cognitive scientists, and neuroscientists inspired me to develop and apply novel machine learning approaches. Furthermore, it inspired me to apply what I learned about human cognition to achieve more human-like transfer learning, continual learning, and representation learning neural network algorithms.
