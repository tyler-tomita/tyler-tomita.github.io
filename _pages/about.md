I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences at Johns Hopkins, supervised by Dr. Christopher Honey. My research involves developing robust and flexible machine learning systems. In particular, I am interested in understanding how multi-task learning, cognitive flexibility, and transfer is achieved in humans, and then using this understanding to implement robust lifelong learning machines. I am also interested in developing and applying machine learning approaches to identify patterns in complex naturalistic human behavioral data. Thus, I have experience in both machine learning research/development and conducting human psychology experiments. Prior to my current position, I obtained my PhD in Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins under the supervision of Dr. Joshua Vogelstein. During my PhD, I developed and characterized novel decision forest-based machine learning algorithms.
